    🔗 Added PostgreSQL Database Connection Configuration
    
    In this commit, we configured the database connection settings for PostgreSQL in our Laravel project. The following changes were made:
    
    ✅ Updated the .env file to include PostgreSQL as the database connection driver.
    ⚙️ Set the host, port, database name, username, and password to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    🔌 Enabled the PDO PostgreSQL extension in the PHP configuration (php.ini) on Windows.
    🛠️ Created a database connection test route and controller to ensure the connection is successful.
    👁️‍🗨️ Verified that the PostgreSQL extension is enabled by checking the PHP Info page.
    
    This configuration allows our Laravel application to connect to the PostgreSQL database, ensuring proper database functionality.
